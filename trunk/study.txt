1.) Name of program: echo; Parameter: hello
2.) Total number of entries: 66,718
3.) TLB misses with 4 KB pages and 100 TLB slots: 76
	Total TLB misses with 64 KB pages and 100 TLB slots: 15
4.) WS size is 11
5.) 4 KB pages, number of pages being 12: 2528 Hard Page faults using fifo 
    (not fifo2)
	64 KB pages, number of pages being 12: 22 Hard Page faults using fifo 
	(not fifo2)

Reasoning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Echo with one parameter has an astonishingly large number of entries for such
a simple program.  With larger page sizes, the TLB can access a larger space
of addresses.  Therefore, given any particular memory access there's a smaller
chance of falling outside the TLB's addressable range.  With larger pages we 
can take advantage of spatial locality; with a larger TLB size we observe 
fewer TLB misses overall.  The page references over the time period of the 
window reference the same pages frequently.  Therefore echo also exhibits 
temporal locality as seen by the average working set size of 11 pages.
Just as we saw using with the TLB, with a larger page size we observe fewer
page faults, which was to be expected because of the memory addresses accessed
by echo.
